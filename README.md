# Demo

The main focus was on getting the design pixel perfect, and to make it as responsive as possible. The provided PSD was a desktop design, so most time was spent making the grid and the different elements look nice and readable/usable on smaller screens resolutions.

The site doesn't have any interaction to it, it's literally is mostly the accessible DOM and the CSS.

The site was tested in all modern browsers - and it worked without hickups.

## Setup
